When creating my own website resume, I decided to use a soft color selection, clean and minimalistic design, and even rounded shapes to show a professional but not very strict attitude. I used the experience by drawing upon the knowledge that I acquired on the W3Schools in terms of utilizing semantic HTML and external CSS, responsive styling as well as user-friendly navigation. The growing level of interactivity and visual interactions were achieved using such elements as progress bars, a button and embedded maps.

Among the primary issues that I had to encounter, the necessity to check that all the visual details that I used, including the images and downloads, acted properly across the browsers and file paths (particularly without incorporating local files) and learning to organize all of that correctly to work under GitHub Pages may be mentioned. It also took trial and error and time to make the site feel professional and young using simple HTML and CSS.

With the help of this project, I have learned how to create a real web site, starting with a blank page, and how to divide the content and design properly with the help of HTML and CSS, and what the importance of a good user experience and accessibility is in web development. It also assisted me in sharpening my problem-solving abilities and my confidence in the production and delivery of digital media.
