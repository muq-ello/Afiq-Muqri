    <h2>Muhammad Afiq Muqri Bin A. Rahman</h2>
    <p>I am a passionate and motivated student currently pursuing a Diploma in Information Management at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM). With a strong interest in technology, data organization, and user-focused services, I am constantly exploring how information systems can improve efficiency and service delivery in both government and private sectors. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in web development, database handling, and records management, and I am eager to apply these skills in practical, real-world environments.

    During my studies, I have developed a keen understanding of how effective information management supports better decision-making, enhances communication, and maintains organizational integrity. I am also skilled in using tools such as Microsoft Office, HTML/CSS for website development, and various content management systems. Additionally, I value collaboration and have honed my communication skills through group assignments, presentations, and customer-facing training experiences.

    I am enthusiastic about continuous learning, adapting to new technologies, and embracing challenges that contribute to my personal and professional growth.</p>
